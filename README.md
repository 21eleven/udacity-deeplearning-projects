# Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree Projects

This repository contains my project work for the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Udacity.

[(1)](https://github.com/NoahLidell/udacity-deeplearning-projects/blob/master/neural_network_from_scratch/DLND-your-first-neural-network-s2.ipynb) a simple neural network with one hidden layer, built in numpy, to understand the basic intricacies of sigmoid activation functions, forward propagation, backpropagation of error gradient and weight updates.

[(2)](https://github.com/NoahLidell/udacity-deeplearning-projects/blob/master/image_classification_CNN/dlnd_image_classification.ipynb) a convolutional neural network in TensorFlow that classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

[(3)](https://github.com/NoahLidell/udacity-deeplearning-projects/blob/master/tv_script_generation_LSTM/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb) a LSTM neural network in TensorFlow that generated novel “The Simpsons” dialogue. 

[(4)](https://github.com/NoahLidell/udacity-deeplearning-projects/blob/master/language_translation_RNN/dlnd_language_translation.ipynb) a sequence to sequence recurrent neural network in TensorFlow that translated English to French.

[(5)](https://github.com/NoahLidell/udacity-deeplearning-projects/blob/master/face_generation_GAN/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb) a generative adversarial network in TensorFlow that produced novel faces based on a dataset of human faces.
